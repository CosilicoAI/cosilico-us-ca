# California Revenue and Taxation Code § 17043
# Mental Health Services Tax
#
# Enacted by Proposition 63 (2004), the Mental Health Services Act
# imposes an additional 1% tax on taxable income exceeding $1 million.
#
# "For each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2005,
# in addition to any other taxes imposed by this part, an additional
# tax at the rate of 1 percent is hereby imposed on that portion of
# a taxpayer's taxable income in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000)."
#
# Combined with the 12.3% top bracket, this creates an effective
# top marginal rate of 13.3% for California's highest earners.

formula:
  # Tax applies only to income exceeding $1 million
  excess_income = max(0, taxable_income - mhs_threshold)
  return excess_income * mhs_rate

defined_for:
  taxable_income > mhs_threshold

default 0

# Example calculations:
# - Taxable income of $1,200,000 -> MHS tax = $200,000 * 0.01 = $2,000
# - Taxable income of $2,500,000 -> MHS tax = $1,500,000 * 0.01 = $15,000
# - Taxable income of $800,000 -> MHS tax = $0 (below threshold)
