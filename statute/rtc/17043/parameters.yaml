description: Mental Health Services Tax threshold and rate

# The threshold and rate are fixed in statute (not indexed for inflation)
# Effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2005

threshold: 1000000  # $1,000,000
rate: 0.01          # 1%

# Note: The MHS tax was modified by Proposition 1 (March 2024)
# which rebranded MHSA as the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA)
# but the 1% tax on income over $1 million remains unchanged.

# Historical context:
# - Enacted: November 2004 (Prop 63)
# - Effective: January 1, 2005
# - Modified: March 2024 (Prop 1) - expanded use of funds to include
#   substance use disorders and housing, but tax structure unchanged
